--Personal file for listing current problems I need to fix--
~~~ = Done
??? = WIP

~~~CSCD212LabMethods:
	-fillArrayList method is close to working. I just need to figure out how I should create the
FootballPlayer, BaseballPlayer, and HockeyPlayer objects with the variables I've already gathered. 
Then I need to figure out how to turn those into a Player[] array, since the Team constructor 
requires that (along with city and teamName)


???Team:
	-calculateTaxes() and calculatePayroll() are confusing to me, and the API does not make it
obvious to me how I should work with these.
	-toString() is just downright confusing. I'm not sure if I need to put a large String statement,
variables, or both.


???Player:
	-Player() constructor may need some work, but this can wait until I've figured out the others


???BaseballPlayer, FootballPlayer, HockeyPlayer:
	-clone() methods in each SHOULD be fine, but it is a new topic. These may need some reworking
for proper cloning to take place.


~~~TeamPayrollComparator:
	-The compare() method MAY be wrong, but I won't know until I get the code running.


check for this. and final
